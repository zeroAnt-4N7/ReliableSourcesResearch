			  What is our topic, and why did we choose it?
		  </p>
          <p class="content-paragraph">
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  Inspired by a presentation from our Applied Computing teacher about data being manipulated to support an agenda, we decided to investigate just how susceptible the public is to fake news sources and unsupported facts/studies. This topic is relevant to today’s issues as misinformation regarding the shape of the earth, COVID vaccines, even Bill Gates for some reason, spreads like wildfire across biassed journalism and social media. By providing tips on how to avoid falling for fake facts, we could even educate people in the process.

			  What is the aim of our infographic website?
		  </p>
		  
		  <p class="content-paragraph">
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  Our infographic will primarily serve to inform, with elements of persuasion encouraging people to not take every piece of data at face value. The aim of this website is to make people aware of how easy it is to be fooled by seemingly sound facts, while educating them on how to avoid falling for them in future.

			  Who is the audience we are trying to reach?
		  </p>
		  
		  <p class="content-paragraph">
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  The target audience mostly includes people who have constant access to the internet, especially social media, and gather their information regarding contemporary events online. Popular social media sites such as TikTok, Facebook and Instagram are infamous for spreading untrue information with ease, so making people aware of how easy it is to make up convincing but fake facts will hopefully encourage them to take everything they learn online with a grain of salt.

			  What primary data are we looking for?
		  </p>
		  
		  <p class="content-paragraph">
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  We intend to gather primary data by testing people’s ability to distinguish between reliable sources and unreliable ones, perhaps by giving them examples of true and false facts and asking them to distinguish between the two. This will provide insight into the thought processes and natural scepticism of the general public.

			  What secondary data are we going to collect?
		  </p>
		  
		  <p class="content-paragraph">
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  The secondary data we will gather will likely relate to the demographics on different news sites or social media. We may also look into studies on how much of the information found on the internet is not backed up by reliable sources. Hopefully the information we find isn’t biassed or untrue.

			  <br>
			  How will we ensure reliability?
		  </p>
		  
		  <p class="content-paragraph">
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  All secondary data will be collected from reputable sources with all data cited from studies or from their own servers (eg. collecting Google demographic information from Google). While we are aiming to persuade individuals with our infographic via data communicating a clear message, this intent will not be hidden and no data will be manipulated in any way. We will also ensure that the data is categorised in a manner that does not produce statistical errors or inconsistencies.

			  How will we ensure confidentiality?
		  </p>
		  
		  <p class="content-paragraph">
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  All data will be stored anonymously and won’t be openly shared. In addition to the site to record primary data, we will include a consent form with clear explanations on the future use of the data. The survey will be created and shared via Google Forms, due to its reputation for simple but secure data storage, and helpful “anonymous participant” option preventing us from attaining any sensitive information that does not relate to the project (eg. Email, name, etc…)
